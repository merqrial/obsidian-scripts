[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a second brain software.
It holds all the information for you in simple plain text [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files.

Obsidian also has a very big ecosystem of plug-ins to enhance its feature set.
Used effectively, it can be your calendar, your to-do manager and even your resource folder.

Javascript is a first citizen there.
This repo contains scripts which are used by me, which some others may find useful as well.
